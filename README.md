# ProtOS- - - -///
> ProtOS is a small hobby operating system for real modern hardware. Lots of plans and little time.

## Planned
GRUB and UEFI compatibility, high modularity and speed. Single-file NIX-style configuration. Easy to understand, readable code, good documentation. As a result, easy to maintain and extend. For now - in C. In the future, it may be rewritten in zig when the language becomes more mature. I love C, but it's almost 60 years old.



## TODO
```
- boot.asm.....................|0
- Basic makefile...............|0
- grub.cfg.....................|1
- Make mb2 tags parser.........|0
- IDT and GDT..................|0
- Basic graphics driver........|0
- Text mode driver.............|0
- Keyboard interrupts handler).|0
- Keyboard and time drivers....|0
- Basic command line (bschell).|0
```

When all this is done, I will update the TODO. While the implementation is in progress, I will put 1 next to the completed tasks.

Full documentation in the future. I will write it parallel with working on other things.
