**ProtOS** is a kernel that shouldn't exist.  
Born from insomnia and spite, it's:

- A 32-bit time capsule for broken hardware
- Your terminal aesthetic's toxic ex.

---

### **Why Bother?**
- **Because 1993 called** - Let's rebuild UNIX but with RGB  
- **For the aesthetic** - Light-blue text on black background never hurt anyone 

(except your retinas)  
- **Actual reason** - I forgot how to stop coding this. Just another hyperfixation.

((I again stayed up until 4AM coding to My Bloody Valentine albums))

---

```bash
# Clone with surgical hatred
git clone https://github.com/GasFurr/ProtOS.git && cd ProtOS

# Build instructions for the brave
make && make run  # Pray to your favorite dead computer scientist

make bios # If you love VGA. No, VGA not working.

make release # Funny, *release*
```

---

### **Changelog (alpha v0.3.0 )**
```
+ Pretends to handle keyboard interrupts
+ Added existential crisis to shell  
- Removed hope. Changed system philosophy.
! Font now 12% more buggy.
```

---

### Current State of the Union:
- **What works**:  
  `Keyboard?` Sorta  
  `Screen?` Pixel vomit  
  `Hope?` ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

- **What doesn't**:  
  `Your expectations`
