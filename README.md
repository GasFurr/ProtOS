# ProtOS Legacy
ProtOS Legacy - First experimental version of my hobby OS. I dont really like how it looks and feels.
It is absolutely unmaintainable and unstructurized mess. I wont update it.

Have some features:

- Basic VGA.
- Some basic commands (shutdown timer doesnt work.)
- Keyboard handler.
- Grub bootloader.

---

To build you need grub, nasm, gcc, ld.
To test you need qemu-system-i386.
thats it.
