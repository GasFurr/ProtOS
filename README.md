**ProtOS** is a WIP ernel that shouldn't exist.  
Born from insomnia and spite, it's:

- A 32-bit time capsule for broken hardware
- Your terminal aesthetic's toxic ex.

---

### **Why Bother?**

- **Because 1993 called** - Let's rebuild UNIX in ZIG with RGB and white monster.
- **For the aesthetic** - Light-blue text on black background never hurt anyone.
- **Actual reason** - I forgot how to stop coding this.

---

### **Changelog (alpha v0.3.1 )**

```
- Deleted everything.
```

---

### Current State of the Union

- **What works**:  
  `Nothing`

- **What doesn't**:  
  `Everything.`

---

### **Legal-ish Stuff**

MIT Licensed - Do crimes with this code idc.
(Just add "© GasFurr" somewhere)
