# ProtOS- - - -///


ProtOS is a small hobbyist operating system for real modern hardware. Lots of plans and little time.

# Planned

GRUB and UEFI compatibility, high modularity and speed. Single-file NIX-style configuration. Easy to understand, readable code, good documentation. As a result, easy to maintain and extend. For now - in rust. In the future, it may be rewritten in zig when the language becomes more mature. I love C, but it's almost 60 years old.



# TODO

- boot.asm                     |0
- Basic makefile               |0
- grub.cfg                     |V

When all this is done, I will update the TODO. While the implementation is in progress, I will put it next to the completed tasks V.

Full documentation in the future. I will write it parallel with working on other things.
